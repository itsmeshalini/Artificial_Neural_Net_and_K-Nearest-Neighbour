# Artificial_Neural_Nets_KNN
Experimentation with Artificial Neural nets with different no of layers and node size and KNN
We will be using the two datasets for the experimentation

Dataset_1 = SGEMM GPU kernel performance Data Set available for download at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SGEMM+GPU+kernel+performance

Data_set2 = Audit data set is available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn/audit-data
